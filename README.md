## 🌟 Overview

RiskGuard is a state-of-the-art fraud detection system designed to protect e-commerce platforms from malicious activities. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-time data analysis, it provides accurate risk scoring for every order, enabling merchants to make informed decisions.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡ Real-time Risk Scoring:** Instant verification of orders against 10 sophisticated fraud detection rules using Llama 3.3.
*   **🌍 Geolocation Intelligence:** Cross-references IP addresses with shipping and residency data to detect inconsistencies.
*   **🏠 AI-Powered Address Validation:** Uses Llama 3.1 to validate delivery addresses, ensuring they are genuine and logically sound.
*   **📚 Historical Context:** Analyzes historical order data (phone, email, address) to identify recurring patterns of fraud.
*   **⚖️ Dynamic Risk Bands:** Implements a strict scoring system (0-40) with automated recommendations (Ship vs. Manual Review).
*   **📱 Secure Phone Input:** Integrated international phone number validation with country code matching.
*   **📊 Interactive Dashboard:** A comprehensive UI to visualize risk trends, order details, and real-time analysis logs.

## 📈 Risk Scoring & Decision Logic

RiskGuard uses a deterministic scoring model combined with AI-powered checks to evaluate order safety.

### ⚖️ Scoring Tiers
Every order is assigned a final **Risk Score** between **0 and 40**, which dictates the system's recommendation:

*   **0 Points** → ✅ **Ship (No Risk)**: The order passed all penalty checks. Automated fulfillment is recommended.
*   **1–40 Points** → ⚠️ **Manual Review**: One or more risk factors were detected. Human intervention is required to verify the customer's intent.

---

### 🔍 How Points are Allocated

The engine evaluates **10 distinct rules**. These are categorized into **Informational Checks** and **Penalty Rules**.

#### 1. Informational Checks (0 Points)
These rules are used to gather context or verify basic data points. They **never** increase the risk score, even if they fail.
*   **Rule #1: Contact Specificity** — Ensures the email and phone are unique to this transaction.
*   **Rule #2: City Verification** — AI confirms the city exists within the stated country.

#### 2. Penalty Rules (+5 Points Each)
These rules represent specific fraud indicators. Every time a penalty rule is triggered, **exactly 5 points** are added to the total score.
*   **Rule #3: Hurry Order** — Flags rapid-fire orders (e.g., 3 orders in 10 minutes) from the same email.
*   **Rule #4: Address Reuse** — Flags when multiple different names use the exact same delivery address.
*   **Rule #5: Postal Validation** — Checks if the ZIP/Postal code actually matches the City/State via ZipcodeStack API.
*   **Rule #6: Email Identity Mismatch** — Flags if an email associated with "John Doe" is suddenly used by "Jane Smith".
*   **Rule #7: Phone Identity Mismatch** — Flags if a phone number is shared across unrelated user accounts.
*   **Rule #8: City/Address Conflict** — Flags when the 'City' field doesn't match the city mentioned in the 'Street Address'.
*   **Rule #9: Phone/Country Mismatch** — Validates that the phone's country code (e.g., +44) matches the shipping country (e.g., United Kingdom).
*   **Rule #10: AI Address Logic** — Llama 3.1 analyzes the address string to detect "fake" or "keyboard mash" addresses (e.g., "asdf 123 lane").
